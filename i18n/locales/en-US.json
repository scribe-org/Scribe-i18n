This SERVICE is provided by SCRIBE at no cost and is intended for use as is.\n\nThis privacy policy (POLICY) is used to inform the reader of the policies for the access, tracking, collection, retention, use, and disclosure of personal information (USER INFORMATION) and usage data (USER DATA) for all individuals who make use of this SERVICE (USERS).\n\nUSER INFORMATION is specifically defined as any information related to the USERS themselves or the devices they use to access the SERVICE.\n\nUSER DATA is specifically defined as any text that is typed or actions that are done by the USERS while using the SERVICE.\n\n1. Policy Statement\n\nThis SERVICE does not access, track, collect, retain, use, or disclose any USER INFORMATION or USER DATA.\n\n2. Do Not Track\n\nUSERS contacting SCRIBE to ask that their USER INFORMATION and USER DATA not be tracked will be provided with a copy of this POLICY as well as a link to all source codes as proof that they are not being tracked.\n\n3. Third-Party Data\n\nThis SERVICE makes use of third-party data. All data used in the creation of this SERVICE comes from sources that allow its full use in the manner done so by the SERVICE. Specifically, the data for this SERVICE comes from Wikidata, Wikipedia and Unicode. Wikidata states that, \"All structured data in the main, property and lexeme namespaces is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 License; text in other namespaces is made available under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License.\" The policy detailing Wikidata data usage can be found at https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Licensing. Wikipedia states that text data, the type of data used by the SERVICE, \"… can be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license\".

Third-Party Source Code\n\nThis SERVICE was based on third-party code. All source code used in the creation of this SERVICE comes from sources that allow its full use in the manner done so by the SERVICE. Specifically, the basis of this project was the project Custom Keyboard by Ethan Sarif-Kattan. Custom Keyboard was released under an MIT license, with this license being available at https://github.com/EthanSK/CustomKeyboard/blob/master/LICENSE.\n\n5. Third-Party Services\n\nThis SERVICE makes use of third-party services to manipulate some of the third-party data. Specifically, data has been translated using models from Hugging Face transformers. This service is covered by an Apache License 2.0, which states that it is available for commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use. The license for the aforementioned service can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/LICENSE.\n\n6.

This SERVICE uses the copyrighted images in a way that matches these criteria, with the only deviation being a rotation of the GitHub logo that is common in the open-source community to indicate that there is a link to the GitHub website.\n\n8. Content Notice\n\nThis SERVICE allows USERS to access linguistic content (CONTENT). Some of this CONTENT could be deemed inappropriate for children and legal minors. Accessing CONTENT using the SERVICE is done in a way that the information is unavailable unless explicitly known.

Updates to this POLICY will replace all prior instances, and if deemed material will further be clearly stated in the next applicable update to the SERVICE. SCRIBE encourages USERS to periodically review this POLICY for the latest information on our privacy practices and to familiarize themselves with any changes.\n\n10.
